        <p>Texas Skills Initiative (TSI) is an initiative in formation and expects to organize as a Texas limited liability company. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you visit our website or submit the stakeholder inquiry form.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact and identity details you provide (name, email).</li>
            <li>Affiliation or role details you provide (organization, role, focus).</li>
            <li>Location details you provide (city, state/region, country).</li>
            <li>Message content you provide through the form.</li>
            <li>Form metadata (handler tier, concierge track, submission ID, timestamps).</li>
            <li>Technical metadata (page path and referrer).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To review stakeholder input and respond when appropriate.</li>
            <li>To improve our regional research and engagement process.</li>
            <li>To maintain system integrity and prevent abuse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
        <p>We do not use third-party advertising or marketing cookies. Any analytics are performed in-house and are intended to understand aggregate site usage rather than track individuals across sites.</p>

        <h2>What We Host</h2>
        <p>This website is hosted on GitHub Pages and serves static informational content about Texas Skills Initiative. The only data we store is the stakeholder inquiry form submission, which is processed through Google Apps Script and stored in Google Drive (Google Sheets).</p>

        <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell personal information. We may share information if required by law or to protect the integrity of our systems.</p>

        <h2>Data Processing & Vendors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>GitHub Pages — website hosting (static content only).</li>
            <li>Google LLC (Google Apps Script + Google Drive/Sheets) — form processing and storage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain submissions for 24 months from the date of submission, then delete or anonymize them unless a longer retention period is required for operational or legal reasons. You may request deletion at the contact below.</p>

        <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>If you submit information from outside the United States, your data may be processed or stored in the United States.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This site is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>Communications</h2>
        <p>We may respond to your inquiry or reach out with relevant updates. You can opt out of non-essential communications at any time.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable safeguards to protect information, but no system can be guaranteed secure.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>For privacy requests or questions, email: <a href="mailto:data@texasskillsinitiative.org">data@texasskillsinitiative.org</a>.</p>
